# Formal Semantic Spine

This document pins the next formalization pass to one canonical object. CDC is
the language; this spine is the semantic kernel that keeps `.cdc`, the paper,
the bootloader, and the witnesses from drifting into parallel descriptions.

## Principle

Every artifact should become a projection of the same semantic spine:

```text
.cdc source
  -> typed AST
  -> runtime state tuple
  -> small-step relation
  -> invariant table
  -> native witnesses
  -> finite proof artifacts
  -> theorem-prover obligations
```

The current repository has a native `.cdc` contract/witness suite and one minimal
Python bootloader. The refinement is to make the formal spine explicit enough
that future reducer code and proofs can be generated from, or audited against,
the same native source.

Trace/window semantics are derived from this spine. They do not add a fourth
foundational step kind. They name causal observer windows, trace spans, and
measurement records over `flow`, `commit`, and `nest`.

## AST

The AST should represent only the canonical calculus primitives:

- `CellTerm`: phase, amplitude, intrinsic frequency, plasticity, optional latch.
- `ModuleTerm`: named cell vector plus belief, prior, precision, and action gain.
- `ChannelTerm`: source path, destination path, weight, delay, angular phase bias,
  optional line projection, and plasticity flag.
- `FieldTerm`: modules, channels, child fields, timestep, gain, deadband, gating.
- `CounterTerm`: register-machine witness term for universality.
- `WindowSpec`, `TraceSpan`, `ObserverSpec`, `MeasurementRecord`,
  `WindowPolicy`, `AgencySummary`, and `IncidenceSpec`: derived observer,
  measurement, local-counter, and policy records over the same field state.

`kernel.cdc` now declares the canonical term surface. The native target is for
the same spine to continue growing as `.cdc` terms and transition rules while
`cdc_boot.py` remains only mechanical bootstrap code. See
`NATIVE_SELF_HOSTING_MANDATE.md`.

## Runtime State Tuple

A runtime state is:

```text
S = (t, modules, channels, child_fields, inbound_relations, deadband, dt, gain, gated)
```

Each module state carries:

```text
M = (name, cells, belief, prior, precision, action_gain, child)
```

Each cell state carries:

```text
x = (theta, amplitude, plasticity, omega, sigma, memory)
```

This tuple is the intended bridge between mathematical notation and future
native reducer code. The semantic spine names the immutable shape the native
runtime must instantiate.

## Small-Step Relation

The canonical reduction relation has three step kinds:

| step | source form | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `flow(d)` | `F ->_d F'` | evolve phase, amplitude, belief, and plasticity for duration `d` |
| `commit(m)` | `F ->_beta F'` | guarded quantize/barrier/belief/latch update for module `m` |
| `nest(m)` | `m[[F]]` | exchange parent context downward and child coherence upward |

Operationally, nesting is represented as two automatically installed
path-aware relations at angular bias `alpha=0`: one aggregate child-to-parent
up-cone and one aggregate parent-to-child down-cone for each child module.
General channels may use nonzero `alpha` and projected `lines`, so the original
parent/child cone is the neutral case of the same relation operator.

A future reducer may integrate flow numerically, but the semantic relation is
the source of truth. Numerical choices should be recorded as realization
parameters, not confused with the calculus definition.

## Derived Trace/Window Layer

The trace/window layer records how a bounded observer window sees a field:

```text
phase-time      continuous flow and rotation
event-time      ordered guarded commits
trace-time      phase/event history through a window
```

Trace-time is local. Smooth phase motion can accumulate with zero commit events,
and event density can differ by window. A global tick is a realization detail,
not part of the semantic spine.

The discrete outcome space is balanced ternary: `-1`, `0`, `+1`. The middle
value is resting equilibrium and a real crossing/aperture state, not binary
false. A committing measurement is a guarded balanced-ternary commit plus a
`MeasurementRecord`; passive observation produces a `TraceSpan` and leaves field
dynamics unchanged.

Window policy is recursive but not foundational. It can update the sampling,
commit, adaptation, or projected-state policy for a bounded window while still
reducing through `flow`, `commit`, and `nest`.

## Derived Universal Closure

`universal-close` is a derived rule, not a fourth step kind. Its state record
is the **lifted frame**:

```text
lifted-frame       (projected-phase mod 2*pi, winding count, Z2 sheet, holonomy)
universal-record   the bridge coordinate computed from the closed frame's trace
```

The rule composes the three foundational steps with trace projection, council
decision, and source evolution under one acceptance guard: reciprocal
receptive/radiant cones active in one flow evaluation, half-turn projection
return with sheet inversion, full 720-degree return with sheet restoration and
winding two, holonomy agreement, accepted local commits, and record/decision
coordinate equality — enacting only the runtime-computed record. The finite
sheet-parity lemmas (one turn inverts the Z2 sheet, two turns restore it) are
mechanized in `formal/lean/CDCFinite.lean` and `formal/coq/CDCFinite.v`;
continuous frame transport and holonomy preservation remain queued.

## Typed Invariant Table

Each invariant should have:

- a stable key;
- a mathematical statement;
- the witness file and witness name;
- a finite proof artifact where one exists and a theorem-prover target where it
  remains open.

`laws.cdc` now declares invariant keys and witness links for:

- `gate-abelian`;
- `interfere-monoid`;
- `rotation-linear`;
- `corefold-morphism`;
- `balanced-ternary-carrier`;
- `dyadic-triadic-closure`;
- `existence-viability`;
- `trace-order-locality`;
- `preservation`;
- `soundness`;
- `local-confluence`;
- `flow-additivity`;
- `normalforms`;
- `universal-closure`.

## Projection Targets

### `.cdc`

The native reducer pilot now parses `native_reducer.cdc` into an executable
runtime state and emits a small reducer IR for source-declared `flow`, `commit`,
and `nest` jobs. The broader parser should eventually produce the AST directly
rather than executing line by line. The current `cdc_boot.py` can then become:

```text
parse .cdc -> ProgramTerm -> initialize RuntimeState -> reduce -> check expects
```

The stronger self-hosting target is:

```text
parse .cdc -> native kernel terms -> native reducer transitions -> native expects
```

At that point a host language is no longer the semantic center; it is only one
replaceable loader for a language that can describe itself.

### `cdc_boot.py`

The bootloader must remain a loader/checker only: read `.cdc`, collect
declarations, verify expectations, and report. It must not grow reducer
semantics back into Python.

### Native Witness Files

`laws.cdc`, `bridge64.cdc`, `bridge_codebooks.cdc`, `bridge512.cdc`,
`bridge4096.cdc`, `bridge_jobs.cdc`, `native_reducer.cdc`,
`native_surface.cdc`, `council_bridge.cdc`, `system.cdc`, `relations.cdc`, and
`trace_windows.cdc` should remain the native
witness surface. Each witness declares the invariant or capability it discharges.

`runtime/cdc_bridge_runtime.c` is the first operational consumer outside Python:
it reads `bridge64.cdc`, validates the finite table, performs lookup, projects
trace occupancy into bridge coordinates, executes source-declared jobs from
`bridge_jobs.cdc`, regenerates/verifies the `bridge512.cdc` and `bridge4096.cdc`
higher-arity codebooks, and emits the visible interactive 64-cell grid.

`runtime/cdc_native_runtime.c` is the first operational reducer consumer outside
Python: it reads `native_reducer.cdc`, executes source-declared flow, commit,
and nest jobs, emits reducer IR, interprets that IR, and checks the finite n=6
balanced-ternary walk spectrum. It also consumes `native_surface.cdc` to
exercise guard, trace, measure, policy, bridge, and counter clauses, and consumes
`council_bridge.cdc` to exercise source-declared council deliberation and
bridge-coordinate source evolution.

### Paper

The paper should present the same AST/state/reduction/invariant table, then
state which parts are currently native witness declarations and which parts are
future formal proof obligations.

### Lean/Coq/Kani

The first formal target is now represented three ways: native C proof checking,
Lean source, and Coq source for the finite n=6 balanced-ternary carrier layer
plus finite algebraic laws. The checked finite layer covers:

1. trit quantization;
2. prefix-walk admissibility;
3. commit barrier preservation;
4. localized normal forms;
5. finite gate associativity/commutativity/identity/inverse;
6. finite interference associativity/commutativity/unit;
7. finite rotation linearity.

The next formal step is to extend those artifacts from finite carrier and
finite-algebra witnesses into commit-barrier preservation, then the flow
relation under explicit Lipschitz/determinism assumptions.

## Acceptance Criteria For The Next Pass

- `.cdc` grows from declaration parsing into `ProgramTerm`.
- `cdc_boot.py` remains a minimal loader/checker and does not accumulate reducer semantics.
- `native_reducer.cdc` and `native_surface.cdc` keep executable flow/commit/nest,
  guard, trace, measure, policy, bridge, and counter clauses synchronized with
  the native runtime.
- `bridge64.cdc` stays as the explicit finite bootstrap codebook and the C
  bridge runtime stays a verified consumer of that source.
- `bridge_codebooks.cdc` records the higher-arity growth rule for `n=9` and
  `n=12`; `bridge512.cdc` and `bridge4096.cdc` contain the full generated rows
  and must match runtime regeneration.
- relation witnesses cover angular phase, dimension projection, path endpoints,
  and `.cdc` nesting auto-cone installation.
- trace/window witnesses cover passive observation, committing measurement,
  trace additivity, causal windows, observer roles, incidence projections,
  local counters, recursive window policy, coupled observation, agency summaries,
  trace-order locality, and projected higher-order boundaries.
- every witness in `.cdc` references an invariant or capability key.
- the paper's invariant table matches `laws.cdc`.
- deleted host files stay deleted; replacements live in `.cdc`.
- `scripts/verify.sh` proves code, `.cdc`, witnesses, native reducer execution,
  finite proof checks, and semantic registry stay synchronized.

This is the path from native contract calculus to theorem-prover-ready calculus
without losing the working system.
