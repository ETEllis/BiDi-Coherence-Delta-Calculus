# Build Decisions — BiDi/CDC lane

Format: decision id, date, decision, rationale, consequences. Append-only.

## D1 — 2026-07-22 — Amendment adopted as binding over the toolchain plan

The CDC Toolchain + Memory Manifold Full-Build Amendment (2026-07-22) is
adopted as an amendment to `CDC_TOOLCHAIN_PLAN.md`, not a competing rewrite.
Where the original plan text conflicts, the amendment governs; the specific
supersessions are recorded in the plan's Amendment Record section. Execution
follows the amendment's Phase A–L sequence with this repository owning the
generic language/runtime/toolchain concerns only (no Memory Manifold product
code here beyond a small conformance fixture).

## D2 — 2026-07-22 — Interim digest algorithm

Amendment A3 mandates BLAKE3 (content) + Ed25519 (signatures) as canonical.
Neither is vendored yet. Until the vendored BLAKE3 lands (Phase B/D), Phase A
provenance records use git object ids plus SHA-256, labeled interim. All
interim records are re-digested with BLAKE3 when it lands; the re-digest is
recorded as evidence, and no public claim may rest on an interim digest.

## D3 — 2026-07-22 — Capability identifier partition

G9 (toolchain driver), H6–H11 (toolchain frameworks), H12–H17 (Memory
Manifold frameworks) reserved as listed in `CDC_MEMORY_MANIFOLD_INTERFACE.md`
§2. Live registry (A–F, G1–G8, H1–H5, U1) is untouched. No identifier reuse.

## D4 — 2026-07-22 — Remote-environment baseline

This lane executes in the Claude Code remote container against the GitHub
remote (`ETEllis/BiDi-Coherence-Delta-Calculus`). The operator-local branch
`codex/mobius-u-identity-system` @ `313f0a167a755b94f102969291a4f9ba415ed4f7`
named by the amendment was never pushed to this remote and is unreachable
here. The Phase A freeze therefore records the observed remote identity
(`origin/main` = 8cfe48f, work branch HEAD at freeze = 99747e0). If the
operator later pushes the local branch, a reconciliation pass compares it
against this baseline before any of its content is treated as canonical.

## D5 — 2026-07-22 — Grammar quirk preservation for parity

The legacy loader strips `#` comments before shell-style splitting
(`cdc_boot.py` `strip_comment` → `split_line`), so `#` truncates a line even
inside a quoted attribute value. The grammar-1 frontend must replicate this
behavior exactly while the legacy path is the differential oracle, and must
record it as a typed diagnostic candidate. Changing the behavior is a
grammar-version bump, never a silent fix.

## D8 — 2026-07-23 — Adversarial review adopted; identity branch integration

The PR #3 Adversarial Gate Review (2026-07-23) is adopted as binding:
verdict repair-and-continue. Both blocking defects (diagnostic fixed-slot
overflow; unreadable/special paths accepted as empty programs) are repaired
with permanent counterexample tests hard-gated in `verify.sh` (including
under ASan/UBSan). Gate-state language is corrected to: CT0 PARTIAL, CT1
PASS (with the counterexamples incorporated), CT2 SEED/PARTIAL; the plan
commit is not a gate. Review item C3 is resolved by an exact derived
statement gate (records + structural end lines).

D4's "unreachable/unpushed" statement about
`codex/mobius-u-identity-system` is hereby scoped to the 2026-07-22 freeze
moment: the branch now exists at
`origin/codex/mobius-u-identity-system` = `313f0a1`, sharing merge base
`8cfe48f` with the PR branch — visible parallel history, not corruption.
Integration decision: merge that branch into the PR branch as the combined
tip (the only authorized push target), resolving `scripts/verify.sh`,
`.gitignore`, and `README.md` overlaps intentionally, and require the
combined tree to pass the full gate before PR #3 leaves draft. Note: the
identity branch carries Python under `tools/blender/` — outside the
root-scoped host boundary enforced by kernel.cdc/verify.sh, and owned by
the identity/product lane, not the language substrate; recorded here so the
boundary claim stays precise.

## D7 — 2026-07-22 — Bootloader `--dump` differential record (gated host code)

`cdc_boot.py` gains a `--dump` flag emitting one declaration record per parsed
line (and raw token records for `expect` lines), used by gate CT1 to compare
the legacy loader field-for-field against the grammar-1 frontend
(`runtime/cdc_frontend_check.c dump`). This is host code inside the one
permitted host file, paired with the named deletion gate
**frontend-differential-dump**: the flag is deleted together with the legacy
line scanner when CT1 completes and no production command parses with the
legacy path. Dump mode changes no loader semantics (records are printed from
the same parse the loader already performs; expectations are not evaluated in
dump mode).

## D6 — 2026-07-22 — Single work branch and PR

All BiDi/CDC lane work lands on the session-designated branch
`claude/bun-equivalent-build-plan-lxe772` (draft PR #3), committing at gate
boundaries, rather than per-phase branches. Rationale: the branch is the
authorized push target for this execution environment; PR #3 carries CI
(`verify.sh --require-formal`) on every push, which enforces the
every-commit-green discipline the amendment requires.
