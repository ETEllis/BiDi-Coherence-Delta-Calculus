# framework_loop.cdc -- the generic task loop as one continuous composition.
# One declared organism travels the whole loop: sense -> gate -> act ->
# integrate -> record -> consolidate -> recall -> decide -> enact -> refine,
# and then begins the next cycle. The `run` and `interpret` modes execute two
# full sense/act/integrate cycles over one shared state object -- the second
# cycle's expectations (theta 0.492228, belief 1.333333) are only reachable
# through state carried forward from the first, so the composition is
# executed, not merely described. The `surface`, `council`, and `evolve`
# modes exercise gate, record, recall, refine, key, decide, and enact over
# the same declared source. The decision coordinate equals the recorded
# episode key (110101 -> 311): what the organism records is what it decides.
